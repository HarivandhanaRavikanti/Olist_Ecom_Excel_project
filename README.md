My Analysis:


Weekday Vs Weekend Payment Statistics:
The Majority of order Payments are done on weekdays. This suggests that customers tends to make purchases and complete 
payments more frequently during the weekdays compared to weekends. 
This indicates that customers  are less active in terms of making payment during leisure time.
These insights can help to tailor marketing strategies, operations and product offerings to optimize sales on both weekdays and weekends
 
No. of Orders with review score 5 and payment type as credit card:
The analysis indicates that a significant number of customers have given a review score of 5 indicating high satisfaction with their purchases from Olist. 	
Analysis also reveals that 76% of payments are done using credit cards. This implies that credit cards are most preferred payment mode by customers. 
The positive feedback can be attributed to various factors such as Product Quality, Timely delivery, excellent customer service and 
smooth payment process facilitated by credit card transaction.

Average price and payment values from customers of sao paulo city:
Average sales of sao paulo city is below the overall average, this indicates that business in the city are facing challenges 
in attracting customers or competing with businesses in other locations. This could be due to 
factors such as changing customer preferences,  increased competition or a decline in the city's attractiveness as a commercial hub 
Businesses in the city may need to re-evaluate their strategies, pricing models, 
marketing approach and product offerings to adapt the changing market conditions. 
This could involve exploring new markets, improving customer experiences or investing innovation to regain competitiveness and stimulate sales growth.


Relationship between shipping days Vs review scores:
Shorter shipping days may positively impact review scores. When customers receive their orders quickly and 
within the expected timeframe, they are more likely to have a positive perception of the shopping experience, leading to higher review scores. 
Conversely, longer shipping days or delays may result in negative customer experiences and lower review scores.
It's important to note that other factors can also influence review scores, such as product quality, customer service, and 
overall satisfaction with the purchase. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis would require considering these additional factors as well.
